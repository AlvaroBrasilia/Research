# Simple API test

## Overview
ClientDemo Service Layer API
This server was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project.  

### Running the server
To run the server, run:

```
npm start
```

To view the Swagger UI interface:

```
open http://localhost:8080/docs
```

This project leverages the mega-awesome [swagger-tools](https://github.com/apigee-127/swagger-tools) middleware which does most all the work.
